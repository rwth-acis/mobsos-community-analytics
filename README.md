# Continuous Community Analytics

In this repository, there are two APIs deployed as las2peer services. Information on how to deploy them can be found within the corresponding directory. The queries are visualized in a Web App.

## Frontend
Web Application for formulating and visualizing queries. In order to deploy the frontend, the attribute *APIURL* in *frontend/config.js* has to be set to the address at which the graphQL API is running.
